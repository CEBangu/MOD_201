# Computational Neuroscience (Applied)
This repository contains work done for the applied Computational Neuroscience class at ENS (Master in Cognitive Science [Cogmaster]), in 2024. It is organized by homework topic, the chronology of which is indicated below. 
This course was focused on applied projects: simulations and mathematical modelling work. 
The outcome of each project is a multi-page report. The code used to do the simulation and generate the figures can be found in the accompanying notebooks. 

## Infectious Diseases
This project aimed to Model the spread of infectious diseases, exploring the SI model. 

## Neural Dynamics
This project explored models of the neuron and its spiking dynamics. It covers the modelling of neural spike trains, and the analysis of these simulations. It then extends this analysis to real neural data, 
namely data from a somatosensory neuron of a monkey. Finally, it considers two different models of the neuron: Leaky Integrate and Fire, and Hodgkin & Huxley. It gives an overview of these models, with some derivations, 
and examines how their dynamics evolve given different input current. 

## Neural Networks
This project explores a variety of neural networks. It first considers simple networks: the autapse neuron (a single self-connected neuron), and coupled neurons. It considers these models as dynamical systems, and explores their dynamics
from this perspective: Fixed points, 0 crossings, null-clines, and regimes. It then moves on to more complex networks. There we first consider Hoppfield Networks, and probe their storage limits. And finally, we explore a Ring Attractor network, 
using PCA to analyze its dynamics.
